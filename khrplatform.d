/* Khronos platform-specific types and definitions.
 *
 * The master copy of khrplatform.h is maintained in the Khronos EGL
 * Registry repository at https://github.com/KhronosGroup/EGL-Registry
 * The last semantic modification to khrplatform.h was at commit ID:
 *      67a3e0864c2d75ea5287b9f3d2eb74a745936692
 *
 * Adopters may modify this file to suit their platform. Adopters are
 * encouraged to submit platform specific modifications to the Khronos
 * group so that they can be included in future versions of this file.
 * Please submit changes by filing pull requests or issues on
 * the EGL Registry repository linked above.

 *
 * See the Implementer's Guidelines for information about where this file
 * should be located on your system and for more details of its use:
 *    http://www.khronos.org/registry/implementers_guide.pdf
 *
 * This file should be included as
 *        #include <KHR/khrplatform.h>
 * by Khronos client API header files that use its types and defines.
 *
 * The types in khrplatform.h should only be used to define API-specific types.
 *
 * Types defined in khrplatform.h:
 *    khronos_int8_t              signed   8  bit
 *    khronos_uint8_t             unsigned 8  bit
 *    khronos_int16_t             signed   16 bit
 *    khronos_uint16_t            unsigned 16 bit
 *    khronos_int32_t             signed   32 bit
 *    khronos_uint32_t            unsigned 32 bit
 *    khronos_int64_t             signed   64 bit
 *    khronos_uint64_t            unsigned 64 bit
 *    khronos_intptr_t            signed   same number of bits as a pointer
 *    khronos_uintptr_t           unsigned same number of bits as a pointer
 *    khronos_ssize_t             signed   size
 *    khronos_usize_t             unsigned size
 *    khronos_float_t             signed   32 bit floating point
 *    khronos_time_ns_t           unsigned 64 bit time in nanoseconds
 *    khronos_utime_nanoseconds_t unsigned time interval or absolute time in
 *                                         nanoseconds
 *    khronos_stime_nanoseconds_t signed time interval in nanoseconds
 *    khronos_boolean_enum_t      enumerated boolean type. This should
 *      only be used as a base type when a client API's boolean type is
 *      an enum. Client APIs which use an integer or other type for
 *      booleans cannot use this as the base type for their boolean.
 *
 * Tokens defined in khrplatform.h:
 *
 *    KHRONOS_FALSE, KHRONOS_TRUE Enumerated boolean false/true values.
 *
 *    KHRONOS_SUPPORT_INT64 is 1 if 64 bit integers are supported; otherwise 0.
 *    KHRONOS_SUPPORT_FLOAT is 1 if floats are supported; otherwise 0.
 *
 * Calling convention macros defined in this file:
 *    KHRONOS_APICALL
 *    KHRONOS_APIENTRY
 *    KHRONOS_APIATTRIBUTES
 *
 * These may be used in function prototypes as:
 *
 *      KHRONOS_APICALL void KHRONOS_APIENTRY funcname(
 *                                  int arg1,
 *                                  int arg2) KHRONOS_APIATTRIBUTES;
